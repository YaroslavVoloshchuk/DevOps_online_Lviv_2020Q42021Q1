Then I read the Linux help system (command `man man` and `man info`) Example: `man passwd`

Example of a command with two keys: `passwd -S -a`

Then I read about `more` and `less` commands using the help system. Search .bash* files in the home directory (`ls -la`) View the content of files .bash:

`less .bashrc`

Then I installed Finger - command is a user information lookup command which gives details of all the users logged in. (`sudo apt install finger`) and read the documentation for the finger command and created file `.plan`.  Example: `finger voloshchuk`

And list the contents of the home directory using the ls command (`ls -la`)

An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/). In other words we can say absolute path is a complete path from start of actual filesystem from / directory.
Some examples of absolute path:

`/var/log/kernel`

`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`

Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory(pwd). Suppose I am located in /home/voloshchuk and I want to change directory to /home/voloshchuk/labs. I can use relative path concept to change directory to labs.

`$ pwd`

`/home/voloshchuk`

`$cd labs/`

`$pwd`

`/home/voloshchuk/labs`


Navigate to the home directory from anywhere in the filesystem is to use command `cd` with the tilde (~) character, as shown below:

`cd ~`
